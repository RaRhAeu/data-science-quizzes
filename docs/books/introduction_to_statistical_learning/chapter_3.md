### 1. Select true statements based on information below

$\hat{y}$ = $\hat{\beta_0}$ + $\hat{\beta_1}$*$x$ 

<Answer>

$\hat{y}$ is true variable

</Answer>
<Answer correct=true>

$\hat{y}$ is prediction of $y$

</Answer>
<Answer correct=true>

$\hat{\beta_0}$ and $\hat{\beta_1}$ are coefficients

</Answer>
<Answer>

$\hat{\beta_0}$ is responsible for "slope" of the line

</Answer>


### 2. Select true statements

<Answer>

While fitting linear (not polynomial) regression RSS always can be equal to 0

</Answer>
<Answer>

Coefficients can be found only throught iterative optimization methods

</Answer>
<Answer correct=true>

Standard error for $\hat{\beta_0}$ is dependent on n, therefore biased, but it is asymtotically unbiased 

</Answer>
<Answer>

Standard error for $\hat{\beta_1}$ is dependent on n, therefore biased, but it is asymtotically unbiased 

</Answer>
<Answer>

Standard errors cannot be used to perform hypothesis test on coefficients

</Answer>

### 3. Look at formulas below and answer the questions: 

$RSS = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-2}*RSS}$   \
$RSS = \sum{i=1}{n}(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2$   \
$R^2 = \frac{TSS - RSS}{TSS} = 1 - \frac{RSS}{TSS}$, \
where $TSS = \sum{i=1}{n}(y_i - \overline{y_i})^2$

now please select true statements

<Answer correct=true>

TSS measures the total variance in the response Y

</Answer>
<Answer correct=true>

$R^2$ is always between 0 and 1

</Answer>
<Answer correct=true>

$R^2$ measures the proportion of variability in Y that can be explained using X

</Answer>
